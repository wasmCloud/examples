# wasmCloud Pet Clinic
The wasmCloud Pet Clinic example application is a WebAssembly and wasmCloud-based reimagining of the classic [Spring Boot microservices Pet
Clinic](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-microservices) example.

## Application Architecture
The wasmCloud Pet Clinic consists of the following five [actors](./actors):
* [Clinic API](./actors/clinicapi/README.md) - The main JSON (aka "REST") API gateway for
  interacting with the service
* [Customers](./actors/customers/README.md) - Customers/Owners Actor - roughly equivalent to the
  original Customers/Owners microservice.
* [Vets](./actors/vets/README.md) - Veterinarians actor, roughly equivalent to the original Vets
  service.
* [Visits](./actors/visits/README.md) - Visits service, roughly equivalent to the original visits
  service.
* [UI](./actors/ui/README.md) - An actor that contains all assets for the petclinic UI. This actor
  will serve the assets through the Clinic API

The wasmCloud Pet Clinic application has a simple architecture: simply start all five of the actors,
push a link definition between the **Clinic API** actor and an **HTTP Server** capability provider,
and then push link definitions between the Customers, Vets, and Visits actors and a relational
database. Lastly, ensure that both the HTTP Server and relational database capability providers are
started.

## Running the Petclinic

If you'd like a quick out of the box example of the petclinic, you can use the included `run.sh`
script to automatically spin up a running wasmcloud host, database, and all the actors. This does
require `docker` to be installed as all the dependencies are run as docker images. To start
everything, run:

```console
$ ./run.sh all
```

To cleanup everything when you are done:

```console
$ ./run.sh wipe
```

Once it is running, you should be able to access the PetClinic application on `localhost:8080`
