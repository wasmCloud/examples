## Build and Run

- To compile the actor and generate a signed Webassembly module, type `make`.
- To load and start the actor you'll need to have a running OCI-compatible
registry. Check that `REG_URL` setting in Makefile is correct, and run
`make push` and `make start` to push the actor to the registry
and start the actor.
Alternately, you can load and start the actor from the host's web ui.
When prompted for the path, 
select `build/clinicapi_s.wasm`.

The actor must be linked with an HttpServer capability 
provider with the contract id `wasmcloud:httpserver` and signed with `wasmcloud:builtin:logging`. You can start the
provider via the `wasmcloud.azurecr.io/httpserver:0.14.4` OCI URL.
