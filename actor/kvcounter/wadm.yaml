# This is a full example of how to run the kvcounter actor exposed with an HTTP server. Using this
# example requires you to have a Redis server running locally (though the linkdef can be modified to
# use a Redis server you have running elsewhere) and WADM running:
#
# https://github.com/wasmCloud/wadm/tree/main/wadm. You can deploy this example with a simple command:
#
# `wash app deploy wadm.yaml`
